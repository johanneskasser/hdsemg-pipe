## Dashboard

The dashboard is the central interface of the hdsemg-pipe application, providing an overview of all loaded HDsEMG files and their associated channels. It guides users through the process of loading, analysing and preparing HDsEMG data for the decomposition stage.

The dashboard consists of several key components:
- **Folder Structure**: Displays the content of the current working directory once a file or folder is opened. It shows:
  - The path of the working directory on your local machine.
  - The folder structure generated by the application, which includes subdirectories shown in the [hdsemg-pipe folder structure](#hdsemg-pipe-folder-structure) section.
  - By going through the steps of the processing pipeline, the folder structure will be updated to reflect the current state of the data processing with the generated files.
- **hdsemg-pipe Steps**: A list of steps in the HDsEMG processing pipeline, which includes:
  - Load Files
  - Grid Association
  - Define Region of Interest
  - Channel Cleaning
  - Decomposition
> Once a step is successfully completed, it will be marked with a check icon. If a step is not completed, it will be marked with a warning icon and the user will be prompted to complete the step before proceeding to the next one.
